    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Garlic Prawns – who feels like a big pile of plump juicy prawns laced with lemon garlic butter?? Hands down, my favourite way to cook prawns! Quick and easy, never fails to impress. The secret ingredient? A splash of white wine. It makes all the difference.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>butter</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
        <li>prawns</li>
        <li>lemon juice</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely chop some cloves of garlic and parsley</li>
        <li>Then, in a hot pan, add some oil and a knob of butter. After letting the butter melt, add in chopped garlic</li>
        <li>Then, add in the prawns. Fry and sauté them under high heat. (They’ll cook very quickly, so be careful not to over-cook them)</li>
        <li>Once done, serve them in a bowl and squeeze in some lemon on top. Garnish with some parsley, and it’s ready to serve. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
